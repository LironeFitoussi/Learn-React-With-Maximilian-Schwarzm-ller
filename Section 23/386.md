# Deploying a React Application to Firebase Hosting

This guide walks through the process of deploying a React application to Firebase Hosting, a static site hosting service.

## Prerequisites

1. A built React application (run `npm run build` first)
2. A Google account
3. Node.js and npm installed on your system

## Step 1: Set Up Firebase Project

1. Go to the Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project" and follow the setup process
3. Name your project (e.g., "React Deployment Demo")
4. Create the project (you can skip enabling Google Analytics)

## Step 2: Install Firebase CLI

Run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Note: On macOS, you might need to use `sudo` for this command.

## Step 3: Log in to Firebase

Run:

```
firebase login
```

Follow the prompts to log in with your Google account.

## Step 4: Initialize Firebase in Your Project

1. In your project directory, run:

   ```
   firebase init
   ```

2. Select "Hosting" from the list of features
3. Choose "Use an existing project" and select your Firebase project
4. When asked about the public directory, enter `build` (not `public`)
5. Configure as a single-page app: Yes
6. Set up automatic builds and deploys: No
7. Don't overwrite `build/index.html`: No

## Step 5: Deploy to Firebase

Run:

```
firebase deploy
```

This command uploads your files to Firebase. After completion, it provides a URL where your site is hosted.

## Additional Information

- To add a custom domain, use the Firebase Console
- To take your site offline, run:
  ```
  firebase hosting:disable
  ```

## Key Points

- React single-page applications are static websites, consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Firebase Hosting is suitable for static sites as it doesn't require server-side code execution
- The deployment process involves setting up a Firebase project, installing CLI tools, and using command-line instructions to upload your built React app

Remember, this process deploys the contents of your `build` folder, so always run `npm run build` before deploying to ensure you're uploading the latest version of your app.
