**Compound Elements** 
Compound Elements are elements that are made up of other elements. They are used to group elements together and apply the same style to them. For example, a div element is a compound element that can contain other elements.

for example with `<select>` and `<option>`:
        
    <select>
      <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
      <option value="saab">Saab</option>
      <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
      <option value="audi">Audi</option>
    </select>
