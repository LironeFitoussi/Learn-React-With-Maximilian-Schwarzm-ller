# Tanstack Query Course Section: Setup and Important Notes

## Official Documentation

- It's recommended to consult the official Tanstack Query documentation.
- Ensure you're referring to the latest version (Version 5 at the time of recording).

## Project Structure

The starting project contains two main parts:

1. **React Frontend**
   - Located in the main project folder
   - Contains pre-built components
   - Focus will be on implementing Tanstack Query

2. **Backend**
   - Located in the `backend` folder
   - Provides a dummy backend for API requests
   - Built with Node.js and Express.js
   - No need to modify this code

## Setup Instructions

### For Local Development

1. Install dependencies for the main project:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   Keep this process running.

4. In a new terminal, navigate back to the main project folder and start the frontend server:
   ```
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Visit the provided address in your browser to view the project.

### For CodeSandbox Users

- No additional setup required
- The project should be pre-configured and running

## Important Notes

- The React project comes with pre-built components.
- The focus is on implementing and using Tanstack Query, not building the UI components.
- The backend provides a simulated API for practice.
- Familiarity with Node.js and Express.js is not required to complete this section.

## Next Steps

With the setup complete, you're ready to dive into learning about Tanstack Query, its benefits, and how to implement it in a React application.

Remember to keep both the frontend and backend servers running throughout your work on this section of the course.
